### What is a Martingale Betting Strategy?

Instead of betting the same amount every hand, the *martingale betting strategy* suggests that after you lose one hand, you should double your bet the next hand over and over again until you win the hand and recoup all your losses from the previous hands.

This project will create a framework to develop win-loss probabilities and betting outcomes:
  1. Establish card identities and meanings.
  2. Create a player's card that the player will base his/her actions (hit, stay, etc) off of that can be easily manipulated and referenced throughout.
  3. Create a win-loss-draw probability calculator based on player's card and dealer's shown card.
  4. Create a blackjack simulator that will simulate and track the player's chip count based on his/her player card and betting strategy.
  5. Finally, provide a full visualization dashboard of insights gathered from the determined experiment.
